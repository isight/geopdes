% OP_U_V_MP: assemble the mass matrix M = [m(i,j)], m(i,j) = (mu u_j, v_i), in a multipatch domain.
%
%   mat = op_u_v_mp (spu, spv, msh, [coeff], [patches]);
%
% INPUT:
%
%  spu:     object representing the space of trial functions (see sp_multipatch_C1)
%  spv:     object representing the space of test functions (see sp_multipatch_C1)
%  msh:     object defining the domain partition and the quadrature rule (see msh_multipatch)
%  coeff:   function handle to compute the reaction coefficient. Equal to one if left empty.
%  patches: list of patches where the integrals have to be computed. By default, all patches are selected.
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%  mat:    assembled mass matrix
