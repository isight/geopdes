% SP_REFINE: construct a refined space from a given one. The function only
%                refines the space, the mesh must be refined separately.
%
%     [sp_fine, Proj] = sp_refine (space, msh, nsub, [degree], [regularity]);
%
% The same number of subdivisions, degree and regularity is applied to every patch
%
% INPUTS:
%     
%     space:      the coarse space, an object of the sp_multipatch class (see sp_multipatch)
%     msh:        an object of the msh_multipatch class, usuallly the refined mesh (see msh_multipatch)
%     nsub:       number of uniform subdivisions to apply on each knot span, and for each direction
%     degree:     degree of the fine space, and for each direction
%     regularity: regularity for the new space, and for each direction
%   
% OUTPUT:
%
%     sp_fine: the refined space, an object of the class sp_multipatch (see sp_multipatch)
%     Proj:    the coefficients relating 1D splines of the coarse and the fine spaces for each patch. 
%                A cell-array of size 1 x npatch, each entry containing the
%                coefficients for the patch (either for scalar or vector-valued spaces).
