% OP_SU_EV_MP: assemble the matrix A = [a(i,j)], a(i,j) = 1/2 (sigma (u_j), epsilon (v_i)), in a multipatch domain.
%
%   mat = op_su_ev_mp (spu, spv, msh, lambda, mu, [patches]);
%
% INPUT:
%    
%   spu:     object representing the space of trial functions (see sp_multipatch)
%   spv:     object representing the space of test functions (see sp_multipatch)
%   msh:     object that defines the domain partition and the quadrature rule (see msh_multipatch)
%   lambda, mu: function handles to compute the Lame' coefficients
%   patches: list of patches where the integrals have to be computed. By default, all patches are selected.
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%   mat:    assembled matrix
