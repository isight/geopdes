% OP_KL_SHELLS_MP: assemble the Kirchhoff-Love shell stiffness matrix.
%
%   mat = op_KL_shells_mp (spu, spv, msh, E_coeff, nu_coeff, t_coeff, [patches]);
%   [rows, cols, values] = op_KL_shells_mp (spu, spv, msh, E_coeff, nu_coeff, t_coeff, [patches]);
%
% INPUT:
%
%  spu:   object representing the space of trial functions (see sp_multipatch_C1)
%  spv:   object representing the space of test functions (see sp_multipatch_C1)
%  msh:   object defining the domain partition and the quadrature rule (see msh_cartesian)
%  E_coeff:  function handle to compute the Young's modulus
%  nu_coeff: function handle to compute the Poisson's ratio
%  t_coeff:  thickness of the shell, scalar value
%   patches: list of patches where the integrals have to be computed. By default, all patches are selected.

% OUTPUT:
%
%  mat:    assembled stiffness matrix
