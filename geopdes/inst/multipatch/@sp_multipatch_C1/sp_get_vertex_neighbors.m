% SP_GET_VERTEX_NEIGHBORS: Compute the indices of elements in the support
%   of vertex functions, separated by patches
%
% cell_indices = sp_get_vertex_neighbors (space, msh, vertex_index, patch_indices)
%
% INPUT:
%    space:   object defining the space of discrete functions (see sp_multipatch_C1)
%    msh:     object defining the domain partition and the quadrature rule (see msh_multipatch)
%    vertex_index: indices of the vertex for which to compute the cells.
%    patch_indices: local indices (w.r.t. vertex) for the patches on which to
%                    compute the cells.
%
% OUTPUT:
%    cell_indices: indices of the functions that interact with the given ones.
