% MSH_CELLS_NEAR_VERTEX: Identify the elements adjacent to given vertices
%
%     [all_adjacent_elemens, elems_near_vertex] = msh_cells_near_vertex (msh, vertices)
%
% INPUT:
%
%    msh:      multipatch mesh object (see msh_multipatch)
%    vertices: struct containing the vertex information (see vertices_struct)
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%    all_adjacent_elements: elements adjacents to any of the input vertices.
%    elems_near_vertex: for each vertex in the input, list of elements
%        adjacent to the vertex (cell-array, to allow different valences).
