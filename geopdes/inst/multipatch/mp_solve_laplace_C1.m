% MP_SOLVE_LAPLACE_C1: solve the Laplacian problem in a multipatch geometry, with C1 continuity.
%
% Example to solve the diffusion problem
%
%    - div ( epsilon(x) grad (u)) = f    in Omega
%                epsilon(x) du/dn = g    on Gamma_N
%                               u = h    on Gamma_D
%
% where \Omega is an analysis-suitable G1 multipatch domain.
%
% USAGE:
%
%  [geometry, msh, space, u] = 
%          mp_solve_laplace_C1 (problem_data, method_data)
%
% INPUT:
%
%  problem_data: a structure with data of the problem. It contains the fields:
%    - geo_name:     name of the file containing the geometry
%    - nmnn_sides:   sides with Neumann boundary condition (may be empty)
%    - drchlt_sides: sides with Dirichlet boundary condition
%    - c_diff:       diffusion coefficient (epsilon in the equation)
%    - f:            source term
%    - g:            function for Neumann condition (if nmnn_sides is not empty)
%    - h:            function for Dirichlet boundary condition
%
%  method_data : a structure with discretization data. Its fields are:
%    - degree:     degree of the spline functions.
%    - regularity: continuity of the spline functions.
%    - nsub:       number of subelements with respect to the geometry mesh 
%                   (nsub=1 leaves the mesh unchanged)
%    - nquad:      number of points for Gaussian quadrature rule
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%  geometry: array of geometry structures (see geo_load)
%  msh:      multipatch mesh, consisting of several Cartesian meshes (see msh_multipatch)
%  space:    multipatch space, formed by several tensor product spaces plus the connectivity (see sp_multipatch_C1)
%  u:        the computed degrees of freedom
