% SP_NITSCHE_KL_ROTATION: impose zero rotation for Kirchhoff-Love shells using Nitsche method
%
%   N_mat = sp_nitsche_KL_rotation (space, msh, bnd_sides, E_coeff, nu_coeff, thickness, C_penalty)
%
% INPUT:
%     
%    space:     space object (see sp_vector)
%    msh:       mesh object (see msh_cartesian)
%    bnd_sides: boundary sides on which the rotation free condition is imposed
%    E_coeff:   function handle for the Young modulus
%    nu_coeff:  function handle for the Poisson ratio
%    thickness: scalar value for the thickness
%    C_penalty: a penalization term
%   
% OUTPUT:
%
%     N_mat:       the computed matrix, to be added in the left hand-side
