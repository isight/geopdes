% OP_NITSCHE_CONSISTENCY_CAHN_HILLIARD: assemble the matrix A = [a(i,j)], a(i,j) = (epsilon (grad v n)_j, Delta u_i), 
%  with n the normal vector to the boundary, using the same space for trial and test functions.
%
%   mat = op_nitsche_consistency_cahn_hilliard (space, msh, sides, [coeff]);
%
% INPUT:
%
%  space:  object representing the space of trial functions (see sp_scalar)
%  msh:    object defining the mesh (see msh_cartesian)
%  sides:  boundary sides on which to compute the integrals
%  coeff:  function handle to compute the epsilon coefficient. If empty, it is taken equal to one.
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%  mat:    assembled matrix
